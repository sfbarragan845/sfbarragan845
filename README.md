## Hi, my name is Steven Barragan ðŸ‘‹<br>

### Full Stack

As an IT engineer, I have experience in both front-end and back-end technologies, and I have a deep understanding of software development best practices. This allows me to create high quality web and mobile applications that are easy to use and meet user needs. I am committed to progress in all aspects of my life, both personally and professionally. As a natural born entrepreneur, I am always looking for new opportunities to grow and learn. I am adaptable and comfortable working in a wide variety of environments. I am self-taught and always willing to take on new challenges. In addition, I am attentive, organized and, above all, responsible in everything I do.
